- subtitle: Measure assessment performance
  desc: > 
    Calculate assessment performance statistics in accordance with the CCAO
    Data Science Departmentâ€™s Standard Operating Procedure on Sales Ratio Studies.
    The main changes are enforcement of outlier trimming (top and bottom 5% of
    ratios are always dropped) and a strict minimum sample size (N must be >= 30).
    Each function outputs a named list containing the statistic, its confidence
    interval, whether or not the IAAO standard was met, and the number of
    observations used to calculate the statistic.
