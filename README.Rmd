# ccao

A package to manage, distribute, and version control commonly-used
CCAO assessment functions.

## Installation

You can install the released version of assessR directly from GitLab by running the following R command after installing `remotes`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_git("https://gitlab.com/ccao-data-science---modeling/packages/ccao")
```

Once it is installed, you can use it just like any other package. Simply
call `library(ccao)` at the beginning of your script.
