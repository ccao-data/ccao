# CCAO Package <a href='https:/glue.tidyverse.org'><img src='man/figures/logo.png' align="right" height="139" /></a>

A package to manage, distribute, and version control *CCAO-specific* functions. These functions are used throughout CCAO applications, models, and diagnostics. For generalized versions of assessment-related functions, see [assessR](https://gitlab.com/ccao-data-science---modeling/packages/assessr).

## Installation

You can install the released version of `ccao` directly from GitLab by running the following R command after installing `remotes`:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_gitlab("ccao-data-science---modeling/packages/ccao")
```

Once it is installed, you can use it just like any other package. Simply call `library(ccao)` at the beginning of your script.

## Example Usage

This package contains spatial dataframes representing CCAO administrative boundaries. Note that you **must have the `sf` package installed and loaded** in order to correctly load spatial dataframes.

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(sf)
library(ccao)

# Plot township boundaries alone
plot(ccao::town_shp[1], main = "Township Boundaries")
# Plot township boundaries with neighborhoods
plot(ccao::nbhd_shp[1], main = "Townships with Neighborhoods")

```
